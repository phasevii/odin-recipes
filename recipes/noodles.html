        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><em>This dish originated as a form of street food sold by strolling vendors.
                It gets its name from their means of transporting it- long poles held across
                the shoulders. Its humble origins and simple appearance belie a lively, spicy
                dish that was enjoyed by the rich and poor alike, and continues to be both a
                local and international favorite.</em></p>

                        along with all other ingredients.</li>
